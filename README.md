#Math Capstone Project

##Description

This will be a set of programs to create and test different neural network architectures on the same task.
In particular, I will be testing a feedforward network architecture (Convolutional Net), a recurrent neural net
(LSTM), a modular network (bi-direction LSTM), and a modern update to LSTM-like architectures (GRU).

This is not a stand-alone repo, but comes with documentation and a presentation describing the mathematical derivation of
functions used in a neural network, as well as the design and chosen architecture of an LSTM neural network.

These pieces together will act as my mathematics capstone project, culminating in a work that will, hopefully, show
my expertise in areas of mathematics, computer science, and the subfield of artificial intelligence programming.
