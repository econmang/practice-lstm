# Math Capstone Project

## Description

This is a set of programs used to create and test different neural network architectures on a trivial problem to compare performance.
In particular, I have tested a feedforward network architecture (Convolutional Net), a recurrent neural net
(LSTM), a modular network (bi-direction LSTM), and a modern update to LSTM-like architectures (GRU). Each network architecture was tested on differing train/validation/test splits.

This is not a stand-alone repo, but has an accompanying paper and a presentation describing the mathematical derivation of
functions used in a neural network, as well as the design and chosen architecture of an LSTM neural network.

These pieces together act as my mathematics capstone project, culminating in a work that expresses some of the technical knowledge and skills in mathematics, computer science, and the subfield of artificial intelligence programming that I gained during my schooling.
