# Math Capstone Project

## Description

This project was meant to explore the mathematics behind neural networks. In order to do that, I created toy neural newtworks to run against the IMDB movie review dataset. This is a set of programs used to create and test the different neural network architectures to compare performance against this data set.

In particular, I have tested a feedforward network architecture (Convolutional Net), a recurrent neural net
(LSTM), a modular network (bi-direction LSTM), and a modern update to LSTM-like architectures (GRU). Each network architecture was tested on a the same set of different train/validation/test splits.

The accompanying paper and presentation describing the mathematical derivation of functions used in the neural network, as well as the design, chosen architectures, and implementation of the neural networks, are found in the PaperAndPresentation in this project.

These pieces together act as my mathematics capstone project, culminating in a work that expresses some of my technical knowledge and skills in mathematics, computer science, and the subfield of artificial intelligence programming gained during my schooling.
