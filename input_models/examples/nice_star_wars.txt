near perfect star wars movie.....one of the best of this series......
From all aspect this is by far the most attractive movie of star wars series to me. Not that i haven't seen all the movies , rather i am a real fan of star wars movies and i have seen all old and new movies very attentively. Also enjoyed those as well. But to me this is the movie of near perfection and ultimate action to go for.

This movie is about a suspenseful united adventure of rey and Luke with other companions after their entry to jedi world. This adventure is full of twist and turn and sets a real exciting space opera of high voltage conspiracy , actions including different space instruments and arms, and overall a composite world of fantasy and drama. Their adventure brings many past secrets to light and many hidden facts are revealed by this.

The movie is not absolutely concerned with actions and fantasy but it has a good build up of story around a very good plot and the acting as well as the direction , special effects are reasonably well performed.

Those who like to watch fantasy movie will obviously like it. But it is the star wars lovers who will enjoy the most
