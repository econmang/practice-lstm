The film felt a little contrived. Though the plot had a deep view of the sentiment of familial relationships, it didn't explore the theme enough. This made it feel like the pacing of the film was far too slow as they dragged out a narrative that could have been shortened to the initial 15 minutes. Some of the film fell flat with me, the main character feeling as though he couldn't seem to cope with the reality of the world he was facing. The unrealistic weight the movie put on their decisions, though, left me wishing they had, instead, focused on their sister. She had fire, but the film disgraced her character by belittling her down to a manic pixie girl wannabe by the end of the stale film.
